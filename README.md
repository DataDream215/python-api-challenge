Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" The humidity definitley increases and so does the temperature. Rainfall is increased due to the humidity. Jinjong and Taluga have the lowest amount of clouds every day and they are tropical regions.

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that? From the data analysis the temperature depends on humidity, cloudiness, the clouds determine how hot it really gets. Less cloud cover means hotter temperatures.
